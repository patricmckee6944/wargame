Consider a modified version of the card game “War”.
 
In this version, there are two players who are dealt 10 cards each, numbered 1 through 10. 
In each round of the game, player A and player B play a random card from their deck.
The player who plays the higher card takes back their own card, as well as the card of their opponent. 
In the event of a tie, flip a coin to choose the winner at random. The game is over when one player has no cards left. 

Complete the steps below:

A. Write a series of functions that simulates the game and calculates the number of rounds each game takes. 
   Run your program 10,000 times and record each result. Time how long the simulation takes. 

B. Plot a histogram of the distribution of the number of rounds played. Make sure there is a title, legend, and labeled axes. 

C. Re-run the program for a game with 25 distinct cards. How long did this simulation take? 
   Does it vary linearly with respect to the 10 card game?
